## Setting up iTerm2 with Agnoster:
	* first download iterm2
	* download fonts, and set font in both non-acsii and normal to a powerline font
	* set color profile to solarized dark
	* download zsh, oh my zsh
	* (to change between zsh and bash, you can use this command)
	* to change theme, can use robbyrussel or agnoster--agnoster will look bad on normal terminal because of the color fidelity on normal terminal
    * also use warhol package to get colored folders
    * set DEFAULT_USER="[username]" to get rid of the prompt on your normal computer
    * do not dim inactive panes
